# Car Dealership Database Creation in MYSQL
This database was created to showcase basic skills in creating tables and structuring sql queries. 
This  project includes four main tables:

Customers – stores customer information such as name and email, with unique identifiers for each customer.

Companies – holds data about the car dealerships or manufacturers, including company name and contact number.

Items – represents the cars or car parts available for sale, including item codes, descriptions, prices, and their associated company.

Sales – records each transaction, linking customers to purchased items, along with purchase dates.

I used primary keys, foreign keys, and ON DELETE CASCADE constraints to maintain data integrity and optimize queries for analyzing sales trends, tracking customer purchases, and managing dealership inventory more efficiently.
